![Rust](https://github.com/hello-rust/lychee/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)
[![docs.rs](https://docs.rs/lychee/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/lychee)

A fast, async, resource-friendly link checker written in Rust. \
For GitHub links, it can optionally use a [`GITHUB_TOKEN`](#github-token)
to avoid getting blocked by GitHub's rate limiter.

Available as a CLI utility and as a GitHub Action: [lycheeverse/lychee-action](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee-action).

## Contributing to lychee

We'd be thankful for any contribution. \
We try to keep the issue-tracker up-to-date so you can quickly find a task to work on.

Try one of these links to get started:

- [good first issues](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
- [help wanted](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)

## Using the Commandline Client

You can run lychee directly from the commandline.

### Installation

#### Using cargo

```
cargo install lychee
```

#### Using the official Docker image

```
docker pull lycheeverse/lychee
```

#### Using pre-built binaries

We provide binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows for every release. \
You can download them from the [releases page](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee/releases).

## Commandline usage

Run it inside a repository with a `README.md`:

```
lychee
```

You can also specify various types of inputs:

```
# check links on a website:
lychee https://endler.dev/

# check links in a remote file:
lychee https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lycheeverse/lychee/master/README.md

# check links in local file(s):
lychee README.md
lychee test.html info.txt

# check links in local files (by shell glob):
lychee ~/projects/*/README.md

# check links in local files (lychee supports advanced globbing and ~ expansion):
lychee "~/projects/big_project/**/README.*"
# ignore case when globbing, displaying progress and check result for each link:
lychee --glob-ignore-case --progress --verbose "~/projects/**/[r]eadme.*"
```

### GitHub token

Optionally, to avoid getting rate-limited while checking GitHub links, you can
set an environment variable with your Github token like so `GITHUB_TOKEN=xxxx`,
or use the `--github-token` CLI option. It can also be set in the config file.

The token can be generated in your
[GitHub account settings page](https://github.com/settings/tokens). A personal
token with no extra permissions is enough to be able to check public repos links.

### Commandline Parameters

There is an extensive list of commandline parameters to customize the behavior,
see below for a full list.

```
USAGE:
    lychee [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [--] [inputs]...

FLAGS:
    -E, --exclude-all-private    Exclude all private IPs from checking. Equivalent to `--exclude-private --exclude-link-

        --exclude-link-local     Exclude link-local IP address range from checking
        --exclude-loopback       Exclude loopback IP address range from checking
        --exclude-private        Exclude private IP address ranges from checking
        --glob-ignore-case       Ignore case when expanding filesystem path glob inputs
        --help                   Prints help information
    -i, --insecure               Proceed for server connections considered insecure (invalid TLS)
    -p, --progress               Show progress

    -v, --verbose                Verbose program output

OPTIONS:
    -a, --accept <accept>                      Comma-separated list of accepted status codes for valid links
    -b, --base-url <base-url>                  Base URL to check relative URLs
        --basic-auth <basic-auth>              Basic authentication support. E.g. `username:password`
    -c, --config <config-file>                 Configuration file to use [default: ./lychee.toml]
        --exclude <exclude>...                 Exclude URLs from checking (supports regex)
    -f, --format <format>                      Output file format of status report [default: string]
        --github-token <github-token>          GitHub API token to use when checking github.com links, to avoid rate
                                               limiting [env: GITHUB_TOKEN=]
    -h, --headers <headers>...                 Custom request headers
        --include <include>...                 URLs to check (supports regex). Has preference over all excludes
        --max-concurrency <max-concurrency>    Maximum number of concurrent network requests [default: 128]
    -m, --max-redirects <max-redirects>        Maximum number of allowed redirects [default: 10]
    -X, --method <method>                      Request method [default: get]
    -o, --output <output>                      Output file of status report
    -s, --scheme <scheme>                      Only test links with the given scheme (e.g. https)
    -T, --threads <threads>                    Number of threads to utilize. Defaults to number of cores available to
                                               the system
    -t, --timeout <timeout>                    Website timeout from connect to response finished [default: 20]
    -u, --user-agent <user-agent>              User agent [default: lychee/0.5.0]

ARGS:
    <inputs>...    The inputs (where to get links to check from). These can be: files (e.g. `README.md`), file globs
                   (e.g. `"~/git/*/README.md"`), remote URLs (e.g. `https://example.com/README.md`) or standard
                   input (`-`). Prefix with `--` to separate inputs from options that allow multiple arguments
                   [default: README.md]
```

### Exit codes

- `0` for success (all links checked successfully or excluded/skipped as configured)
- `1` for missing inputs and any unexpected runtime failures or config errors
- `2` for link check failures (if any non-excluded link failed the check)

## Library usage

You can use lychee as a library for your own projects.
Simply add it as a dependency and build your client:

```rust
use http::StatusCode

let client = lychee::ClientBuilder::default().build()?;
let url = Url::parse("https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee")?;
let response = client.check(Website(url)).await?;
assert!(matches!(response.status, Status::Ok(_)));
```

The client is very customizable, e.g.

```rust
let client = lychee::ClientBuilder::default()
    .includes(includes)
    .excludes(excludes)
    .max_redirects(cfg.max_redirects)
    .user_agent(cfg.user_agent)
    .allow_insecure(cfg.insecure)
    .custom_headers(headers)
    .method(method)
    .timeout(timeout)
    .verbose(cfg.verbose)
    .github_token(cfg.github_token)
    .scheme(cfg.scheme)
    .accepted(accepted)
    .build()?;
```

See the [builder documentation](https://docs.rs/lychee/latest/lychee/struct.ClientBuilder.html) for all options.

## GitHub Action usage

GitHub Action is available as a separate repository: [lycheeverse/lychee-action](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee-action)
which includes usage instructions.

## Credits

The first prototype of lychee was built in [episode 10 of Hello
Rust](https://hello-rust.show/10/). Thanks to all Github- and Patreon sponsors
for supporting the development since the beginning. Also, thanks to all the
great contributors who have since made this project more mature.
